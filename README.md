# PongEPQ
This repository records my EPQ Project with the working title: Create a program in an unfamiliar language.

## Installation
*Incomplete section

### Requirements
* Unity development environment

## Usage
1. Install program files on Unity using GitUnity asset.
2. Build project by clicking File->Build and Run.
3. Play game.
The game will run without difficulty with and can be opened from the program files to play again and again.

## Controls
* Player 1                 :  WASD keys
* Player 2 (in multiplayer):  Arrow keys
*On the main menu the player can change settings like the paddle shape, the number of players, if the game is timed or not and if the player wants to play in mayhem mode in which there are more balls and the maximum score is 100. 

## Development
The development process took a long time and lots of research. The game is just a prototype as it is my first time using Unity and C#.
